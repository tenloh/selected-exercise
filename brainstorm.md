# Brainstorming

* Need some way to read the RTF file and be able to template in the name
  - Should be at startup of server / application
  - Automatically read from the server files
  - Postmark can use templates

* Need some way to read the CSV file
    - If user is selected employee, should have front end where they can upload CSV

* Check bounce back stastics
    - Would assume they are part of the callback
